# Welcome to Verida Storage Node Server

This server acts as middleware between web applications built using the [Verida Datastore](https://developers.verida.io/docs/concepts/data-storage/) and the underlying databases storing user data.

Key features:

- Ensuring all API requests come from verified Verida network users (via user signed messages)
- Managing database users, linking them to valid DID's
- Managing permissions for individual databases
- Adding a second layer of security by managing per-database ACL validation rules
- Providing applications with user's database connection strings

## Usage

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn run start
```

Note: You may need to update `.env` to point to the appropriate Verida DID Server endpoint to use. By default it points to `testnet`, but you can point to a localhost instance for development purposes (http://localhost:5001) -- note, there is no trailing `/`

This server is running on the Verida Testnet and is accessible by any application built on the Verida network during the pre-launch phase.

- Testnet: https://db.testnet.verida.io:5002/

## Configuration

Edit `.env` to update the configuration:

- `HASH_KEY`: A unique hash key that is used as entropy when generating an alpha numeric username from a DID. Set this to a unique value when first running the server. DO NOT change this key once the server is up and running as you will end up with a mismatch of usernames. If you run multiple servers in front of a cluster of CouchDB instances, all servers must use the same `HASH_KEY`.
- `DID_SERVER_URL`: URL of a Verida DID Server endpoint.
- `DB_PROTOCOL`: Protocol to use when connecting to CouchDB (`http` or `https`).
- `DB_USER`: Username of CouchDB Admin (has access to create users and databases).
- `DB_PASS`: Password of CouchDB Admin.
- `DB_HOST`: Hostname of CouchDB Admin.
- `DB_PORT`: Port of CouchDB server (`5984`).
- `DB_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED_SSL`: Boolean indicating if unauthorized SSL certificates should be rejected (`true` or `false`). Defaults to `false` for development testing. Must be `true` for production environments otherwise SSL certificates won't be verified.
DB_PUBLIC_USER: Alphanumeric string for a public database user. These credentials can be requested by anyone and provide access to all databases where the permissions have been set to `public`.
DB_PUBLIC_PASS: Alphanumeric string for a public database password.

## Setting up environment variables on Windows

* On a powershell execute the following ( replica of `.env` )
```bash
$env:HASH_KEY="wb4f9qf6789bqjqcj0cq4897cqn890tq0"
$env:DID_SERVER_URL="https://dids.testnet.verida.io:5001"
$env:DID_CACHE_DURATION=3600
$env:DB_PROTOCOL="http"
$env:DB_USER="admin"
$env:DB_PASS="admin"
$env:DB_HOST="localhost"
$env:DB_PORT=5984
$env:DB_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED_SSL=false
$env:DB_PUBLIC_USER="784c2n780c9cn0789"
$env:DB_PUBLIC_PASS="784c2n780c9cn0789"
```

## CouchDB configuration

### CORS

CORS must be enabled so that database requests can come from any domain name:


```
[httpd]
enable_cors = true

[cors]
origins = *
```
